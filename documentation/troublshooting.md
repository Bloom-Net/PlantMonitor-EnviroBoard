# Troubleshooting your Enviro setup

Do not despair!

Setting up Enviro is a breeze if you get every answer right first time during setup but it's easy to get into a situation where something in your configuration isn't quite right and it's hard to pin down exactly what it is.

## Step 1. Try the provisioning process again
It's possible we just made an error entering our details, if you put the Enviro back into provisioning mode then it will show you all of the values you previously supplied and allow you to check and edit them if necessary.

## Step 2. Look at the `config.py` file

## Step 3. Inspect the logs

## Step 4. Upgrade your firmware
